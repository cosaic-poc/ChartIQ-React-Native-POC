       *
       * To use this function:
       *
       * 1. Create an implementation that provides the methods for managing markers.
       *
       *    The marker implementation must include a `showMarkers` function that accepts the following
       *    parameters:
       *    - `type` — Categorizes the marker as a circle, square, or specialized type such as
       *      trade or video.
       *    - `renderType` — Specifies the marker class, either [Simple]CIQ.Marker.Simple or
       *      [Performance]CIQ.Marker.Performance.
       *
       *    See the `MarkersSample` class in the *markersSample.js* file in the *examples/markers*
       *    folder of your library for a complete example implementation.
       *
       * 2. Assign the implementation to the `eventMarkersImplementation` property of the chart
       *    configuration object.
       *
       *    For example, from the *sample-template-advanced.html* template (in the *examples/templates*
       *    folder of your library):
       *    ```
       *    import marker from "./examples/markers/markersSample.js";
       *
       *    const config = getDefaultConfig({
       *        markerSample: marker.MarkersSample,

       *        .
       *    });
       *    ```
       *
       *    The `markerSample` parameter is assigned to the `eventMarkersImplementation` property of the
       *    chart configuration object.
