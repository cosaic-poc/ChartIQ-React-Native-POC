     * The market class is what the chart uses to to manage market hours for the different exchanges.
     * It uses `Market Definitions` to decide when the market is open or closed.
     * Although you can construct many market classes with different definitions to be used in your functions, only one market definition can be attached to the chart at any given time.
     * Once a market is defined, an [iterator]CIQ.Market#newIterator can be created to traverse through time, taking into account the market hours.
     * Additionally, a variety of convenience functions can be used to check the market status, such as CIQ.Market#isOpen or CIQ.Market#isMarketDay.
     *
     * A chart will operate 24x7, unless a market definition with rules is assigned to it.
     * See CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarket and CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarketFactory for instructions on how to assign a market definition to a chart.
     *
     * The chart also provides convenience functions that allows you to traverse through time at the current chart periodicity without having to explicitly create a new iterator.
     * See CIQ.ChartEngine#getNextInterval and CIQ.ChartEngine#standardMarketIterator for details.
     *
     * **Important:**
     * - If the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on is enabled, **only data within the defined market hours will be displayed on the chart** even if more data is loaded.
     * - Once a market definition is assigned to a chart, it will be used to roll up any data requested by the [periodicity]CIQ.ChartEngine#createDataSet, which will result in any data outside the market hours to be combined with the prior candle.
     * This may at times look like data is being **filtered**, but it is just being **aggregated**. To truly filter data, you must use the above add-on.
     *
     * `Market Definitions` are JavaScript objects which must contain the following elements:
     * - `name` : A string. Name of the market for which the rules are for.
     * - `rules` : An array. The rules indicating the times the market is open or closed. `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time. Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
     * - `market_tz` : A string. Time zone in which the market operates. See CIQ.timeZoneMap to review a list of all chartIQ supported timezones and instructions on how to add more.
     * - `hour_aligned`: A boolean. If set to `true`, market opening and closing times will be forced to the exact start of the hour of time, ignoring any minutes, seconds or millisecond offsets.
     *   > You should set this to `false` if your market opening and closing times are not aligned to the beginning to each hour.
     *   > Otherwise, forcing them to do so causes the iterator to generate `previous` and `next` times that could prevent it from properly moving trough the market hours.
     * - `convertOnDaily` : A boolean. By default, daily charts are not converted for timezone. Set this to true to convert for daily charts.
     * - `beginningDayOfWeek` : Weekday number (0-6) to optionally override CIQ.Market prototype setting of same name.
     * - `normal_daily_open`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal open time for a market.
     * - `normal_daily_close`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal close time for a market.
     * - `minimum_session_length`: The minimum interval of time used to test for a market session open.  See CIQ.Market#minimumSessionLength.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * {
     * 		name: "SAMPLE-MARKET",
     * 		market_tz: "America/Chicago",
     * 		hour_aligned: true,
     * 		beginningDayOfWeek: 0,
     *		normal_daily_open: "09:00",
     *		normal_daily_close: "17:00",
     * 		rules: [
     * 				{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00"}
     * 		]
     * };
     * ```
     *
     * Instructions for creating `Market Definitions`:
     *
     * - An empty market definition ( {} ) assumes the market is always open.
     * - Once a definition has rules in it, the market will be assumed open only for those defined rules. The absence of a rule indicates the market is closed for that timeframe.
     * - Market's time rules are specified in the market's local timezone.
     * - Seconds are not considered for open or close times, but are okay for intra day data.
     * - Rules are processed top to bottom.
     * - Rules can be defined for both primary and secondary market sessions.
     * - Rules for the market's primary session do not have a `name` parameter and are enabled by default.
     * - Rules for the market's primary session are mandatory.
     * - Rules for secondary market sessions, such as pre-market or post-market trading hours sessions,  require a `name` parameter.
     * - All secondary market session are disabled by default.
     *
     * 		This is a rule for a 'pre' market session:
     * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "08:00", "close": "09:30", name: "pre"}`
     *
     * - To enable or disable secondary market session rules by session name, use CIQ.Market#enableSession and CIQ.Market#disableSession.
     *  - **Important:** Enabling/Disabling market sessions will not automatically filter-out data from the chart, but simply adjust the market iterators so the x-axis can be displayed accordingly in the absence of data for the excluded sessions.
     *  - Data filtering can be done:
     *    - Manually by requesting pertinent data from your feed and calling CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart
     *    - Automatically by using the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on.
     * - First, the `dayofweek` wild card rules are processed. As soon as a rule is matched, processing breaks.
     *
     * 		This rule says the market is open every Monday from 9:30 to 16:00:
     * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:30", "close": "16:00"}`
     *
     * - After the `dayofweek` rules are processed all of the extra rules are processed.
     * - Multiple `open` and `close` times can be set for the same day of week. To indicate the market is closed during lunch, for example:
     * 	 ```
     * 	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "12:00"}, // mon
     *	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "13:00", "close": "17:00"}  // mon
     *	 ```
     *   - `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time.
     *   - Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
     *
     * - Wildcard rules should be placed first and more specific rules should be placed later.
     *
     * 		This rule is a wildcard rule for Christmas. If Christmas is on Monday, the
     * 		first set of rules will evaluate to true because the dayofweek rule for day
     * 		one will match. Then this rule will match if the date is the 25th of
     * 		December in any year.  Because open is 00:00 and close is 00:00, it will evaluate to false:
     * 			`{"date": "*-12-25", "open": "00:00", "close": "00:00"}`
     *
     * - After wildcard exceptions, any specific day and time can be matched.
     *
     * 		This rule says closed on this day only. Note that open and closed attributes
     * 		can be omitted to save typing if the market is closed the entire day:
     * 			`{"date": "2016-01-18"} //Martin Luther King day.`
     *
     * 		This rules says closed on 12-26:
     * 			`{"date": "2016-12-26"}, //Observed Christmas in 2016`
     *
     * 		This rule says partial session
     * 			`{"date": "2015-12-24", "open": "9:30", "close": "13:00"} //Christmas eve`
     *
     * See example section for a compete NYSE definition.
     *
     * Once defined, it can be used to create a new market instance.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * var thisMarket = new CIQ.Market(marketDefinition);
     * ```
     *
     * If no definition is provided, the market will operate 24x7.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * new CIQ.Market();
     * ```
     *
     *

    class Market {
      /**
       * The market class is what the chart uses to to manage market hours for the different exchanges.
       * It uses `Market Definitions` to decide when the market is open or closed.
       * Although you can construct many market classes with different definitions to be used in your functions, only one market definition can be attached to the chart at any given time.
       * Once a market is defined, an [iterator]CIQ.Market#newIterator can be created to traverse through time, taking into account the market hours.
       * Additionally, a variety of convenience functions can be used to check the market status, such as CIQ.Market#isOpen or CIQ.Market#isMarketDay.
       *
       * A chart will operate 24x7, unless a market definition with rules is assigned to it.
       * See CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarket and CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarketFactory for instructions on how to assign a market definition to a chart.
       *
       * The chart also provides convenience functions that allows you to traverse through time at the current chart periodicity without having to explicitly create a new iterator.
       * See CIQ.ChartEngine#getNextInterval and CIQ.ChartEngine#standardMarketIterator for details.
       *
       * **Important:**
       * - If the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on is enabled, **only data within the defined market hours will be displayed on the chart** even if more data is loaded.
       * - Once a market definition is assigned to a chart, it will be used to roll up any data requested by the [periodicity]CIQ.ChartEngine#createDataSet, which will result in any data outside the market hours to be combined with the prior candle.
       * This may at times look like data is being **filtered**, but it is just being **aggregated**. To truly filter data, you must use the above add-on.
       *
       * `Market Definitions` are JavaScript objects which must contain the following elements:
       * - `name` : A string. Name of the market for which the rules are for.
       * - `rules` : An array. The rules indicating the times the market is open or closed. `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time. Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
       * - `market_tz` : A string. Time zone in which the market operates. See CIQ.timeZoneMap to review a list of all chartIQ supported timezones and instructions on how to add more.
       * - `hour_aligned`: A boolean. If set to `true`, market opening and closing times will be forced to the exact start of the hour of time, ignoring any minutes, seconds or millisecond offsets.
       *   > You should set this to `false` if your market opening and closing times are not aligned to the beginning to each hour.
       *   > Otherwise, forcing them to do so causes the iterator to generate `previous` and `next` times that could prevent it from properly moving trough the market hours.
       * - `convertOnDaily` : A boolean. By default, daily charts are not converted for timezone. Set this to true to convert for daily charts.
       * - `beginningDayOfWeek` : Weekday number (0-6) to optionally override CIQ.Market prototype setting of same name.
       * - `normal_daily_open`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal open time for a market.
       * - `normal_daily_close`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal close time for a market.
       * - `minimum_session_length`: The minimum interval of time used to test for a market session open.  See CIQ.Market#minimumSessionLength.
       *
       * Example:
       * ```
       * {
       * 		name: "SAMPLE-MARKET",
       * 		market_tz: "America/Chicago",
       * 		hour_aligned: true,
       * 		beginningDayOfWeek: 0,
       *		normal_daily_open: "09:00",
       *		normal_daily_close: "17:00",
       * 		rules: [
       * 				{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00"}
       * 		]
       * };
       * ```
       *
       * Instructions for creating `Market Definitions`:
       *
       * - An empty market definition ( {} ) assumes the market is always open.
       * - Once a definition has rules in it, the market will be assumed open only for those defined rules. The absence of a rule indicates the market is closed for that timeframe.
       * - Market's time rules are specified in the market's local timezone.
       * - Seconds are not considered for open or close times, but are okay for intra day data.
       * - Rules are processed top to bottom.
       * - Rules can be defined for both primary and secondary market sessions.
       * - Rules for the market's primary session do not have a `name` parameter and are enabled by default.
       * - Rules for the market's primary session are mandatory.
       * - Rules for secondary market sessions, such as pre-market or post-market trading hours sessions,  require a `name` parameter.
       * - All secondary market session are disabled by default.
       *
       * 		This is a rule for a 'pre' market session:
       * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "08:00", "close": "09:30", name: "pre"}`
       *
       * - To enable or disable secondary market session rules by session name, use CIQ.Market#enableSession and CIQ.Market#disableSession.
       *  - **Important:** Enabling/Disabling market sessions will not automatically filter-out data from the chart, but simply adjust the market iterators so the x-axis can be displayed accordingly in the absence of data for the excluded sessions.
       *  - Data filtering can be done:
       *    - Manually by requesting pertinent data from your feed and calling CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart
       *    - Automatically by using the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on.
       * - First, the `dayofweek` wild card rules are processed. As soon as a rule is matched, processing breaks.
       *
       * 		This rule says the market is open every Monday from 9:30 to 16:00:
       * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:30", "close": "16:00"}`
       *
       * - After the `dayofweek` rules are processed all of the extra rules are processed.
       * - Multiple `open` and `close` times can be set for the same day of week. To indicate the market is closed during lunch, for example:
       * 	 ```
       * 	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "12:00"}, // mon
       *	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "13:00", "close": "17:00"}  // mon
       *	 ```
       *   - `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time.
       *   - Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
       *
       * - Wildcard rules should be placed first and more specific rules should be placed later.
       *
       * 		This rule is a wildcard rule for Christmas. If Christmas is on Monday, the
       * 		first set of rules will evaluate to true because the dayofweek rule for day
       * 		one will match. Then this rule will match if the date is the 25th of
       * 		December in any year.  Because open is 00:00 and close is 00:00, it will evaluate to false:
       * 			`{"date": "*-12-25", "open": "00:00", "close": "00:00"}`
       *
       * - After wildcard exceptions, any specific day and time can be matched.
       *
       * 		This rule says closed on this day only. Note that open and closed attributes
       * 		can be omitted to save typing if the market is closed the entire day:
       * 			`{"date": "2016-01-18"} //Martin Luther King day.`
       *
       * 		This rules says closed on 12-26:
       * 			`{"date": "2016-12-26"}, //Observed Christmas in 2016`
       *
       * 		This rule says partial session
       * 			`{"date": "2015-12-24", "open": "9:30", "close": "13:00"} //Christmas eve`
       *
       * See example section for a compete NYSE definition.
       *
       * Once defined, it can be used to create a new market instance.
       *
       * Example:
       * ```
       * var thisMarket = new CIQ.Market(marketDefinition);
       * ```
       *
       * If no definition is provided, the market will operate 24x7.
       *
       * Example:
       * ```
       * new CIQ.Market();
       * ```
       *
       * @param [market_definition] A json object that contains the rules for some market. If not defined default market is always open.
       *
       * @since
       * 04-2016-08
       * 06-2016-02 - You can now specify times for different market sessions ('pre',post', etc) to be used with the sessions visualization tools. See CIQ.ExtendedHours.
       *
       * @example
       * CIQ.Market.NYSE = {
       "name": "NYSE",
       "market_tz": "America/New_York",
       "hour_aligned": false,

     * Generates an object that can be used programmatically to load new themes or to create a theme dialog to manage chart themes.
     * The initial values contain the existing values in the current chart.
     * Simply have your dialog modify these values and then call the method CIQ.ThemeHelper#update
     *
     * Note that the chart has many granular customizations beyond what this theme helper produces.
     * This helper simplifies and consolidates into a manageable set.
     * For example 'hallow candles', 'bars' and 'candles' colors are all grouped together.
     * But if you need to separate those out, just call an explicit CIQ.ChartEngine#setStyle for each CSS style right after the ThemeHelper is executed.
     *
     * For example, This will further set the color for the hollow_candle chart type:
     * ```
     * stxx.setStyle("stx_hollow_candle_down","color",'blue');
     * stxx.setStyle("stx_hollow_candle_up","color",'yellow');
     * stxx.setStyle("stx_hollow_candle_even","color",'pink');
     * stxx.draw();
     * ```
     * See {@tutorial Chart Styles and Types} for more details.
     *
     * Generally speaking, themes can be managed by simply adding or removing from the chart context the class name that groups the theme together.
     * And as long as the CSS contains an entry for that class, the chart will display the styles in the class when enabled.
     *
     * For example, assume the chart has a default theme and a second theme called 'ciq-night'.
     * Here are some examples of what CSS entries for those classes would look like:
     * ```
     * // default theme (day) styles
     * .stx_candle_shadow, .stx_bar_even {
     * 		color:#2e383b;
     *
     * }
     * .stx_candle_down, .stx_line_down {
     * 		border-left-color: #000000;
     * }
     *
     * // night theme override styles
     * .ciq-night .stx_candle_shadow, .ciq-night .stx_bar_even {
     * 		color: #ccc;
     * }
     * .ciq-night .stx_candle_down, .ciq-night .stx_line_down {
     * 		border-left-color: #e34621;
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Then to activate a particular theme, you either remove the specific class to enable default (day):
     * ```
     * document.querySelector("cq-context").classList.remove('ciq-night');
     * // clear out the old styles to allow new ones to be cached in; and redraw.
     * stxx.styles={};stxx.draw();
     * ```
     * Or add a particular class to enable those styles:
     * ```
     * document.querySelector("cq-context").classList.add('ciq-night');
     * // clear out the old styles to allow new ones to be cached in; and redraw.
     * stxx.styles={};stxx.draw();
     * ```
     * You can use this method to set as many themes as needed. Remember that this method, requires all styles to be present in the CSS.
     * ThemeHelper, on the other hand, will programmatically set the styles internally, one at a time, regardless of pre-existng CSS classes.
     *
     * @example
     * var helper=new CIQ.ThemeHelper({stx:stx});
     * console.log(helper.settings);
     * helper.settings.chart["Grid Lines"].color="rgba(255,0,0,.5)";

       * Multiple quote feeds may be attached to the engine by including the `filter` parameter, which
       * enables the quote feed driver to determine whether the quote feed should be used for a
       * specified instrument. If a filter is not provided, the quote feed becomes the default quote
       * feed and is used if all other attached quote feeds (which must have filters) do not match the
       * filter criteria.
       *
       * Only one unfiltered quote feed can be attached to the chart engine. If you call this function
       * without a `filter` argument when a default, unfiltered quote feed is already attached, all
       * attached quote feeds, including the default quote feed, are removed, and the object passed to
       * `quoteFeed` is attached as the new default.
       *
       * **Note:** You must attach filtered quote feeds in order of priority. The quote feeds are
       * filtered in the order in which they are attached to the engine. The first quote feed that
       * matches the filter criteria is used. If none of the filtered quote feeds match the criteria,
       * the unfiltered default quote feed is used. The default quote feed can be attached without
       * regard to priority.
       *
       * @param [quoteFeed] Your quote feed object.
       * @param [behavior] Contains initialization parameters for the quote feed.
       * @param [behavior.suppressErrors] If true, then no error is displayed when the quote
       * 		feed returns one. Instead, the new symbol is simply not loaded and the prior symbol
       * 		remains on the screen.
       * @param [behavior.refreshInterval] If not null, then sets the frequency for fetching
       * 		updates (if null or zero then `fetchUpdateData` is not called).
       * @param [behavior.forwardPaginationRetryInterval] Defaults to five seconds when set to
       * 		null. In [historical mode]{@tutorial DataIntegrationQuoteFeeds}, determines how often
       * 		(in seconds) a forward pagination attempt can be tried. Forward pagination is different
       * 		than a fetch update, in that it tries to get enough data just to fill the gap in the
       * 		visible portion of the chart rather than to request an update from the visible area to
       * 		the current candle, which depending on the visible range, could be days or months away.
       * @param [behavior.bufferSize] The minimum number of undisplayed historical ticks that
       * 		will always be buffered in `masterData`. Useful to prevent temporary gaps on studies while
       * 		paginating. This forces pagination fetch requests to be triggered ahead of reaching the
       * 		edge of the chart, if the number of already loaded bars is less than the required buffer
       * 		size. This parameter can be reset at any time by manipulating
       * 		`stxx.quoteDriver.behavior.bufferSize`; it will then become active on the very next
       * 		loading check. It is used on both left and right side pagination requests.
       * @param [behavior.callback] Optional callback after any fetch to enhance
       * 		functionality. It will be called with the params object used with the fetch call.
       * @param [behavior.noLoadMore] If true, then the chart does not attempt to load any
       * 		more data after the initial load.
       * @param [behavior.findHeadOfData] If true, then the chart attempts to load more data
       * 		(and find the most recent) if the initial load returned no data.
       * @param [behavior.loadMoreReplace] If true, then when paginating, the driver replaces
       * 		`masterData` instead of prepending. Set this if your feed can only provide a full data
       * 		set of varying historical lengths.
       * @param [behavior.adjustmentMethod] Overrides the quote feed's default dividend/split
       * 		adjustment method. The value will depend on the particular quote feed implementation.
       * @param [behavior.maximumTicks=20000] Limits the maximum number of ticks to request
       * 		from a quote feed. Setting a value in the quote driver's behavior overrides an
       * 		individual quote feed's `maxTicks` value.
       * @param [behavior.ignoreUpdateError] Indicates that an update that fails should be
       * 		treated as no data found rather than an error.
       * @param [filter] Filters the quote feed provided by the `quoteFeed` parameter. The
       * 		filter function takes an object parameter typically containing `symbolObject`, `symbol`,
       * 		and `interval` properties. The properties associate the quote feed with an instrument.
       * 		If the `filter` function returns true, the quote feed is used for the instrument.

       * INJECTABLE
       *
       * Adds a series of data to the chart.
       *
       * A series can be rendered (for instance like a comparison chart) or it can be hidden (for instance to drive a study).
       *
       * If you have a quotefeed attached to your chart, then just pass the symbol as the first parameter.
       * There is no need to pass data since the chart will automatically fetch it from your quotefeed.
       * If however you are using the "push" method to feed data to your chart then you must provide the data manually by passing it as a parameter.
       *
       * Here's how you would add a hidden series for symbol "IBM" when using a quotefeed:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries("IBM");
       * ```
       *
       * That series will now be available for use by studies, for example, but it will not display on the chart since no rendering details have been provided.
       *
       * If you wish to *display* your series, you must specify how you wish the series to be rendered.
       * At a minimum, you will need to indicate what color should be used to display the series. Like so:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries("IBM", {color:"blue"});
       * ```
       *
       * Once a series is added, it will be tracked in the CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#series object.
       *
       * To remove a series call CIQ.ChartEngine#removeSeries
       *
       * To remove all series from a chart, simply iterate through the active series object and delete them one at a time:
       * ```
       * for(var s in stxx.chart.series){
       *    var series=stxx.chart.series[s];
       *    stxx.removeSeries(series);
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * Example 1 - manually add data to a chart and a series<iframe width="100%" height="500" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" align="top" style="float:top" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chartiq/avem0zcx/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="1"></iframe>
       *
       * The above example adds a series as an overlay, but a more common use case is to display series as comparisons.
       * Comparisons are special because they change the chart from a price chart to a percentage chart.
       * All series on the chart then begin at "zero", on the left side of the chart.
       * Set isComparison=true when adding a series to make it a comparison chart.  As long as a comparison series is on a chart, the chart will display its y-axis in percent scale
       * provided CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#forcePercentComparison is true.
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries("IBM", {color:"blue", isComparison:true});
       * ```
       *
       * **Complex Visualizations**
       *
       * Example 2 - use a custom renderer to display a series<iframe width="100%" height="500" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" align="top" style="float:top" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chartiq/b6pkzrad/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="1"></iframe>
       *
       * Behind the scenes, series are displayed by [renderers]CIQ.Renderer.
       * Renderers can plot lines, mountains, bars, candles, and other types of visualizations.
       +* When adding a series, you can specify which renderer to use and set parameters to control your visualization.
       * For instance, this will display a series as a bar chart on its own left axis:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries(
       * 		"SNE",
       * 		{
       * 			display:"Sony",
       * 			renderer:"Bars",
       * 			name:"test",
       * 			yAxis:{
       * 				position:"left",
       * 				textStyle:"#FFBE00"
       * 			}
       * 		}
       * );
       * ```
       * Which is the same as explicitly declaring a renderer and then attaching it to the series:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries(
       * 		"SNE",
       * 		{
       * 			display:"Sony"
       * 		},
       * 		function(){
       * 			// create the axis
       * 			var axis=new CIQ.ChartEngine.YAxis({position:"left", textStyle:"#FFBE00"});
       *
       * 			//create the renderer and attach
       * 			var renderer=stxx.setSeriesRenderer(
       * 				new CIQ.Renderer.Bars({params:{name:"test", yAxis:axis}})
       * 			);
       * 			renderer.attachSeries("SNE").ready();
       * 		}
       * );
       * ```
       * The above 2 calls do exactly the same thing, just using different syntax.
       *
       * All parameters specified in addSeries will be passed on to the selected renderer. As such, every parameter available for the selected renderer can be used here to further customize the series.
       * For example, to add a step line, you would select a [Lines]CIQ.Renderer.Lines renderer, and then set its `step` attribute, right trough the addSeries API call.
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries(
       * 		"SNE",
       * 		{
       * 			renderer:"Lines",
       * 			step:true,
       * 		}
       * );
       * ```
       *
       * **Advanced Visualizations**
       *
       * Some renderers are capable of rendering *multiple series*.
       * For instance, the [Histogram]CIQ.Renderer.Histogram can display series stacked on top of one another.
       * Use `[setSeriesRenderer()]CIQ.ChartEngine#setSeriesRenderer` in this case.
       * Here is how we would create a stacked histogram from several series:
       * ```
       * var myRenderer=stxx.setSeriesRenderer(new CIQ.Renderer.Histogram({params:{subtype:"stacked"}}));
       *
       * stxx.addSeries("^NIOALL", {},
       * 		function() {myRenderer.attachSeries("^NIOALL","#6B9CF7").ready();}
       * );
       * stxx.addSeries("^NIOAFN", {},
       * 		function() {myRenderer.attachSeries("^NIOAFN","#95B7F6").ready();}
       * );
       * stxx.addSeries("^NIOAMD", {},
       * 		function() {myRenderer.attachSeries("^NIOAMD","#B9D0F5").ready();}
       * );
       * ```
       *
       * Example 3 - advanced stacked histogram renderer<iframe width="100%" height="500" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" align="top" style="float:top" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chartiq/rb423n71/embedded/result,js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="1"></iframe>
       *
       * **Using a Symbol Object**
       *
       * The above examples all assumed your chart uses "tickers" (stock symbols).
       * We refer to complex (compound) symbols as "Symbol Objects" (see CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart).
       * Here's how to set a series with a symbol object:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries(null, {color:"blue", symbolObject:yourSymbolObject});
       * ```
       *
       * **Setting a separate YAxis**
       *
       * By default, series are displayed without a y-axis.
       * They are either "overlayed" on the main chart, or if they are comparisons then they share the standard y-axis.
       * But a series can also take an optional y-axis which can be displayed on the left, or the right side of the chart.
       * To do this, you must specify parameters for a [YAxis]CIQ.ChartEngine.YAxis object and pass to addSeries:
       * ```
       * stxx.addSeries("IBM", {color:"blue", yAxis:{ position:"left" }});
       * ```
       *
       * **Understanding the relationship between [setSeriesRenderer()]CIQ.ChartEngine#setSeriesRenderer and [importLayout]CIQ.ChartEngine#importLayout**
       *
       * It is important to know that a renderer explicitly created using [setSeriesRenderer()]CIQ.ChartEngine#setSeriesRenderer will **not** be stored in the layout serialization.
       * If your implementation will require the complete restoration of a chart layout, you must instead use the syntax that includes all of the renderer parameters as part of this addSeries call.
       *
       *
       * @param [id] The name of the series. If not passed then a unique ID will be assigned. (parameters.symbol and parameters.symbolObject will default to using id if they are not set explicitly *and* id is supplied.)
       * @param [parameters] Parameters to describe the series. Any valid [attachSeries parameters]CIQ.Renderer#attachSeries and [renderer parameters]CIQ.Renderer will be passed to attached renderers.
       * @param [parameters.renderer=CIQ.Renderer.Lines] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to the desired [renderer]CIQ.Renderer for the series.
       * - If not set, defaults to [Lines]CIQ.Renderer.Lines when `color` is set.
       * - Not needed for hidden series.
       * @param [parameters.name] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to specify renderer's name.  Otherwise id will be used.
       * @param [parameters.display=id/symbol] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to the text to display on the legend. If not set, the id of the series will be used (usually symbol).  If id was not provided, will default to symbol.
       * @param [parameters.symbol=id] <span class="injection">Data Loading</span> The symbol to fetch in string format. This will be sent into the fetch() function, if no data is provided.  If no symbol is provided, series will use the `id` as the symbol. If both `symbol` and `symbolObject` are set, `symbolObject` will be used.
       * @param [parameters.symbolObject=id] <span class="injection">Data Loading</span> The symbol to fetch in object format. This will be sent into the fetch() function, if no data is provided. If no symbolObject is provided, series will use the `id` as the symbol. You can send anything you want in the symbol object, but you must always include at least a 'symbol' element. If both `symbol` and `symbolObject` are set, `symbolObject` will be used.
       * @param [parameters.field=Close/Value] <span class="injection">Data Loading</span> Specify an alternative field to draw data from (other than the Close/Value). Must be present in your pushed data objects or returned from the quoteFeed.
       * @param [parameters.isComparison=false] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> If set to true, shareYAxis is automatically set to true to display relative values instead of the primary symbol's price labels. CIQ.ChartEngine#setComparison is also called and set to `true`. This is only applicable when using the primary Y axis, and should only be used with internal addSeries renderers.
       * @param [parameters.shareYAxis=false] <span class="injection">Rendering</span>
       * - Set to `true` so that the series shares the primary Y-axis and renders along actual values and print its corresponding current price label on the y axis.
       * - When set to `false`, the series will not be attached to a y axis. Instead it is superimposed on the chart; taking over its entire height, and maintaining the relative shape of the line. No current price will be displayed. Superimposing the ‘shape’ of one series over a primary chart, is useful when rendering multiple series that do not share a common value range.
       * - This setting will automatically override to true if 'isComparison' is set.
       * - This setting is only applicable when using the primary Y axis and has no effect when using a renderer that has its own axis.
       * @param [parameters.marginTop=0] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Percentage (if less than 1) or pixels (if greater than 1) from top of panel to set the top margin for the series.<BR>**Note:** this parameter is to be used on **subsequent** series rendered on the same axis. To set margins for the first series, CIQ.ChartEngine.YAxis#initialMarginTop needs to be used.<BR>**Note:** not applicable if shareYAxis is set.

To set margins for the first series, CIQ.ChartEngine.YAxis#initialMarginBottom needs to be used.<BR>**Note:** not applicable if shareYAxis is set.
       * @param [parameters.width=1] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Width of line in pixels
       * @param [parameters.minimum] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Minimum value for the series. Overrides CIQ.minMax result.

       * - If `fillGaps` not present
       *   - No gaps will be filled for the series.

       * - Applicable for line-like renderers only (lines, mountains, baselines, etc).
       * - Default:
       *   - `true` for standard series.
       *   - `false` for comparisons.
       * - Set to `true` to use the color and pattern defined by CIQ.ChartEngine#setGapLines for the chart.
       * - Set to `false` to always show gaps.
       * - Set to an actual color string or custom color-pattern object as formatted by CIQ.ChartEngine#setGapLines to define more custom properties.
       * - 'Dots' indicating isolated items will be shown unless a `transparent` color/style is specified.
       * - If not set, and the series is a comparison, the gaps will always be rendered transparent.
       * @param [parameters.fillStyle] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Fill style for mountain chart (if selected). For semi-opaque use rgba(R,G,B,.1).  If not provided a gradient is created with color and baseColor.
       * @param [parameters.permanent=false] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to `true` to activate. Makes series unremoveable by a user **when attached to the default renderer**. If explicitly linked to a renderer, see CIQ.Renderer#attachSeries for details on how to prevent an attached series from being removed by a user.
       * @param [parameters.data] <span class="injection">Data Loading</span> Data source for the series.
       * If this field is omitted, the library will connect to the QuoteFeed (if available) to fetch initial data ( unless `parameters.loadData` is set to `false`), and manage pagination and updates.
       * If data is sent in this field, it will be loaded into the masterData, but series will **not** be managed by the QuoteFeed (if available) for pagination or updates.
       * Items in this array *must* be ordered from earliest to latest date.
       * Accepted formats:
       * **Full OHLC:**
       * An array of properly formatted OHLC quote object(s). [See OHLC Data Format]{@tutorial InputDataFormat}.
       * ----**Price Only:**
       * An array of objects, each one with the followng elements:
       * @param [parameters.data.DT] JavaScript date object or epoch representing data point (overrides Date parameter if present)
       * @param [parameters.data.Date] string date representing data point ( only used if DT parameter is not present)
       * @param [parameters.data.Value] value of the data point ( As an alternative, you can send `parameters.data.Close` since your quote feed may already be returning the data using this element name)
       * @param [parameters.data.Close] value of the data point ( Used as an alternative to `parameters.data.Value`)
       * @param [parameters.panel] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> The panel name on which the series should display. If the panel doesn't exist, one will be created. If `true` is passed, a new panel will also be created.
       * @param [parameters.action='add-series'] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Overrides what action is sent in symbolChange events. Set to null to prevent a symbolChange event.
       * @param [parameters.loadData=true] <span class="injection">Data Loading</span> Include and set to false if you know the initial data is already in the masterData array or will be loaded by another method. The series will be added but no data requested. Note that if you remove this series, the data points linked to it will also be removed which may create issues if required by the chart. If that is the case, you will need to manually remove from the renderer linked to it instead of the underlying series itself.
       * @param [parameters.extendToEndOfDataSet] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to true to plot any gap at the front of the chart.  Automatically done for step charts (set to false to disable) or if parameters.gapDisplayStyle are set (see CIQ.ChartEngine#addSeries)
       * @param [parameters.displayFloatingLabel=false] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> Set to false to disable the display of a Y-axis floating label for this series.
       * @param [parameters.baseline] <span class="injection">Rendering</span> If a boolean value, indicates whether the series renderer draws a baseline. If an object, must be the equivalent of CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#baseline.
       * @param [cb] Callback function to be executed once the fetch returns data from the quoteFeed. It will be called with an error message if the fetch failed: `cb(err);`. Only applicable if no data is provided.
       * @return The series object.
       *
       * @since
       * - 04-2015 If `isComparison` is true shareYAxis is automatically set to true and setComparison(true) called. createDataSet() and draw() are automatically called to immediately render the series.
       * - 15-07-01 If `color` is defined and chartStyle is not set then it is automatically set to "line".
       * - 15-07-01 Ability to use setSeriesRenderer().
       * - 15-07-01 Ability to automatically initialize using the quoteFeed.
       * - 15-07-01 `parameters.quoteFeedCallbackRefresh` no longer used. Instead if `parameters.data.useDefaultQuoteFeed` is set to `true` the series will be initialized and refreshed using the default quote feed. (Original documentation: `{boolean} [parameters.quoteFeedCallbackRefresh]` Set to true if you want the series to use the attached quote feed (if any) to stay in sync with the main symbol as new data is fetched (only available in Advanced package).)
       * - 2015-11-1 `parameters.symbolObject` is now available.
       * - 05-2016-10 `parameters.forceData` is now available.
       * - 09-2016-19 `parameters.data.DT` can also take an epoch number.
       * - 09-2016-19 `parameters.data.useDefaultQuoteFeed` no longer used. If no `parameters.data` is provided the quotefeed will be used.
       * - 3.0.8 `parameters.forceData` no longer used, now all data sent in will be forced.
       * - 3.0.8 `parameters.loadData` added.
       * - 4.0.0 Added `parameters.symbol` (string equivalent of parameters.symboObject).
       * - 4.0.0 Multiple series can now be added for the same underlying symbol. parameters.field or parameters.symbolObject can be used to accomplish this.
       * - 4.0.0 Added `parameters.baseColor`.
       * - 5.1.0 Series data now added to masterData as an object. This allows storage of more than just one data point, facilitating OHLC series!
       * - 5.1.0 addSeries will now create a renderer unless renderer, name and color parameters are all omitted.
       * - 5.1.0 Now also dispatches a "symbolChange" event when pushing data into the chart, rather than only when using a quote feed.
       * - 5.1.1 Added `parameters.extendToEndOfDataSet`.
       * - 5.1.1 `parameters.chartType`, originally used to draw "mountain" series, has been deprecated in favor of the more flexible 'renderer' parameter. It is being maintained for backwards compatibility.
       * - 5.2.0 `parameters.gaps` has been deprecated (but maintained for backwards compatibility) and replaced with `parameters.gapDisplayStyle`.
       * - 6.0.0 `parameters.fillGaps` is now a string type and can accept either "carry" or "gap".  Setting to true will use the value of stxx.cleanupGaps.
       * - 6.2.0 No longer force 'percent'/'linear', when adding/removing comparison series, respectively, unless CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#forcePercentComparison is true. This allows for backwards compatibility with previous UI modules.
       * - 6.3.0 If a panel name is passed into the function, a new panel will be created if one doesn't already exist.
       * - 6.3.0 Added `parameters.displayFloatingLabel`.
       * - 8.1.0 Supports custom baselines. See example.
       * - 8.2.0 Added `parameters.baseline`.

       *
       * Imports a layout (panels, studies, candleWidth, etc) from a previous serialization. See CIQ.ChartEngine#exportLayout.
       *
       * There are three ways to use this method:
       * 1. Preset the layout object in the chart instance, but do not load any data.
       *    - This is usually used to restore an initial 'symbol independent' general layout (chart type and studies mainly) that will then take effect when `loadChart` is subsequently called.
       *    - In this case, exportedLayout should be called using 'withSymbols=false' and the importLayout should have 'noDataLoad=true'.
       * 2. Load an entire new chart and its data, including primary symbol, additional series, studies, chart type, periodicity and range:
       *    - In this case, you should not need call loadChart, setPeriodicity setSpan or setRange, addStudy, etc. since it is all restored from the previously exported layout and loaded using the attached quoteFeed.
       *    - If you still wish to change periodicity, span or range, you must use the CB function to do so.
       *    - In this case, exportedLayout should be called  using 'withSymbols=true' and the importLayout should have 'noDataLoad=false' and 'managePeriodicity=true'.
       * 3. Reset layout on an already existing chart without changing the primary symbol or adding additional symbols:
       *    - This is used when restoring a 'view' on an already existing chart from a previous `loadChart` call. The primary symbol remains the same, no additional series are added, but periodicity, range, studies and chart type are restored from the previously serialized view.
       *    - In this case, exportedLayout should be called  using 'withSymbols=false', and importLayout should have 'noDataLoad=false', managePeriodicity=true', and 'preserveTicksAndCandleWidth=true'.
       *
       * **Important Notes:**
       * - Please note that [studyOverlayEdit]CIQ.ChartEngine~studyOverlayEditEventListener and [studyPanelEdit]CIQ.ChartEngine~studyPanelEditEventListener event listeners must be set *before* you call CIQ.ChartEngine#importLayout.
       * Otherwise your imported studies will not have edit capabilities.
       *
       * - When symbols are loaded, this function will set the primary symbol (first on the serialized symbol list) with CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart
       * and any overlayed symbol with CIQ.ChartEngine#addSeries. You must be using a QuoteFeed to use this workflow.
       *
       * - This method will not remove any currently loaded [series]CIQ.ChartEngine#addSeries.
       * If your restored layout should not include previously loaded series, you must first iterate trough the CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#series object, and systematically call CIQ.ChartEngine#removeSeries on each entry.
       *
       * - When allowing this method to load data, do not call [addSeries]CIQ.ChartEngine#addSeries, [importDrawings]CIQ.ChartEngine#importDrawings or [loadChart]CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart
       * in a way that will cause them to run simultaneously with this method, or the results of the layout load will be unpredictable.
       * Instead use this method's callback to ensure data is loaded in the right order.
       *
       * - Since spans and ranges require changes in data and periodicity,
       * they are only imported if params.managePeriodicity is set to true and params.noDataLoad is set to false.
       * If both range and span are present, range takes precedence.
       *
       * @param config A serialized layout generated by CIQ.ChartEngine#exportLayout.
       * @param [params] Layout behavior parameters.
       * @param [params.noDataLoad] If true, then any automatic data loading from the quotefeed will be skipped, including setting periodicity, spans or ranges.
       * 		<p>Data can only be loaded if a quote feed is attached to the chart.
       * @param [params.managePeriodicity] If true, then the periodicity will be set from the layout, otherwise periodicity will remain as currently set.
       * 		<p>If the span/range was saved in the layout, it will be restored using the most optimal periodicity as determined by CIQ.ChartEngine#setSpan.
       * 		<p>Periodicity can only be managed if a quote feed is attached to the chart.
       * 		<p>Only applicable when noDataLoad = false.
       * 		<p>See CIQ.ChartEngine#setPeriodicity for additional details.
       * @param [params.preserveTicksAndCandleWidth] If true then the current candleWidth (horizontal zoom) and scroll (assuming same periodicity) will be maintained and any spans or ranges present in the config will be ignored. Otherwise candle width and span/ranges will be taken from the config and restored.

       * - 4.0.0 No longer defaulting padding to current value of `preferences.whiteSpace`.
       * - 5.1.0 Added `params.dontSaveRangeToLayout`.
       * - 5.1.0 The selected range will be recorded in the chart CIQ.ChartEngine#layout when it is requested through CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart, or when you call setRange directly.
       * - 5.2.0 `params.forceLoad` is now an option to force loading of new data.
       * @example
       * <caption>Display all of the available data in the current chart periodicity.</caption>
       * stxx.setRange({
       *     dtLeft: stxx.chart.dataSet[0].DT,
       *     dtRight: stxx.chart.dataSet[stxx.chart.dataSet.length - 1].DT,

      /**
       * Sets the chart to display the requested time span.
       *
       * By default, the **minimum width** for a bar is `1px`. As such, there may be times when the requested data will not all fit on the screen, even though it is available.
       * See CIQ.ChartEngine#minimumCandleWidth for instructions on how to override the default to allow more data to display.
       *
       * setSpan makes use of CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange by converting the span requested into a date range.
       * All parameters in setSpan will be sent into setRange (except if 'all' is requested), so you can pre-load things like `params.periodicity` in setSpan for setRange to use.
       *
       * Example:
       * <pre>
       * stxx.setSpan({
       * 	multiplier: 5,
       * 	base: "day",
       * 	padding: 30,
       * 	// pre load a parameter for setRange
       * 	periodicity: {
       * 		period: 1,
       * 		interval: 5,
       * 		timeUnit: 'minute'
       * 	}
       * });
       * </pre>
       *
       * Just keep in mind that if passing `periodicity.period` , `periodicity.timeUnit` and `periodicity.interval` to be used in CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange , then **DO NOT** set `maintainPeriodicity`. Otherwise, the requested periodicity will be ignored.
       *
       * If a quotefeed is attached to the chart (ver 04-2015 and up), setSpan will attempt to gather more data from the feed (IF NEEDED) to fulfill the requested range AND **may override the periodicity** to provide the most optimal chart display.
       * So depending on your UI, **you may need to use the callback to refresh the periodicity displayed on your menu**.
       * Please see CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange and CIQ.ChartEngine#displayAll for complete details on how the periodicity is calculated.
       * If there is no quotefeed attached (or using a version prior to 04-2015), then setStan will use whatever data is available in the masterData. So you must ensure you have preloaded enough to display the requested range.
       *
       * Calling CIQ.ChartEngine#setPeriodicity immediately after setting a span may cause all of the data to be re-fetched at a different periodicity than the one used by the requested span. Once you have set your initial periodicity for the chart, there is no need to manually change it when setting a new span unless you are using the `params.maintainPeriodicity` flag; in which case you want to call `setPeriodicity` **before** you set the span, so the setSpan call will use the pre-set periodicity.
       * Setting a span to `params.multiplier:7` `params.base:'days'` or `params.multiplier:1` `params.base:'week'`, for example, is really the same thing; same span of time. If what you are trying to do is tell the chart how you want the raw data to be fetched, that is done with CIQ.ChartEngine#setPeriodicity or by letting setSpan figure it out as described above.
       * Remember that by default, weekly and monthly data is calculated using daily raw ticks. If your feed returns data already rolled up in monthly or weekly ticks, you can override this behavior by setting `stxx.dontRoll` to `true` ( see CIQ.ChartEngine#dontRoll  and the {@tutorial Periodicity} tutorial)
       *
       * This function must be called **after** loadChart() completes and creates a dataSet, or together with loadChart() by setting the proper parameter values.
       * If calling separately right after loadChart(), be sure to call it in the loadChart() callback!.
       * See example in this section and CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart for more details and compatibility with your current version.
       *
       * Be aware that CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#allowScrollPast and CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#allowScrollFuture must be set to true if you wish to display "white space" in cases where the range requested is larger than the available data.
       * Especially when using "today" and the base.
       *
       * **Layout preservation and the span**
       * If `maintainPeriodicity` is not set, the selected span will be recorded in the chart CIQ.ChartEngine#layout when it is requested through CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart, or when you call setSpan directly.
       * It is then used in CIQ.ChartEngine#importLayout and CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart to reset that span, until a new periodicity is selected.
       *
       * **Note:** versions prior to '2015-05-01' must use the legacy arguments : setSpan(multiplier, base, padding, char,useMarketTZ,cb), and related example in this section.
       *
       * @param params Parameter for the function
       * @param params.multiplier   Number of base units to show. To show 3 weeks of data, for example, set this to 3 and `params.base` to 'week'.
       * @param params.base The base span to show. "minute", "day", "week", "month", "year", "all", "ytd" or "today".
       * Except when using "today", this base will be combined with the multiplier. Example 2 days, 4 months.
       * **Spans are market hours sensitive**, so if you ask for 1 hour, for example, at the time the markets are close,
       * the span will find the last time the markets where open for the active symbol, and include the last market hour in the span.
       * It will also exclude days when the market is closed.
       * - If 'all' data is requested, CIQ.ChartEngine#displayAll is called first to ensure all quotefeed data for that particular instrument is loaded. Note that 'all' will display the data in `monthly` periodicity unless otherwise specified. Please note that "all" will attempt to load all of the data the quotefeed has available for that symbol. Use this span with caution.
       * - If 1 'day' is requested --on market days--the chart will start from the same time on the previous market day, which may be over a weekend. Example from 3:30 PM Friday to 3:30 PM Monday, if the market is closed Saturday and Sunday.
       * - If 1 'day' is requested --on weekends and holidays-- or if 2 or more days are requested, the chart will always start from market open of prior days.
       * - If 'today' is requested --during the market day -- the chart will display the current market day but, if CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#allowScrollFuture is also enabled, extend the chart all the way to market close (as per market hours set in the active market definition - see CIQ.Market)
       * - If 'today' is requested --before the market is open --the chart will display the previous  market day.
       * - If 'today' is requested --after the current market day closes --the chart will display the current  market day.
       * @param [params.maintainPeriodicity] If set to true, it will maintain the current periodicity for the chart instead of trying to select the most optimal periodicity for the selected range. See CIQ.ChartEngine#setRange for details.
       * **Note:** if the chart is in `tick` periodicity, the periodicity will be automatically selected even if it was requested to be maintained because in `tick` periodicity we have no way to know how many ticks to get to fulfill the requested range.
       * @param [params.padding] Whitespace padding in pixels to apply to right side of chart after sizing for date range. If not set will default whitespace to 0.
       * @param [params.forceLoad] Forces a complete load (used by loadChart)
       * @param [params.chart] Which chart, defaults to "chart"
       * @param cb Optional callback
       * @example
       * // this displays 5 days. It can be called anywhere including buttons on the UI
       *	stxx.setSpan ({
       *		multiplier: 5,
       *		base: "day",
       *		padding: 30
       *	});
       * @example
       * // using embedded span requirements on a loadChart() call.
       * stxx.loadChart({symbol: newSymbol, other: 'stuff'}, {
       * 	span: {
       * 		base: 'day',
       * 		multiplier: 2
       * 	},
       * }, callbackFunction());
       * @example
       * // Calling setSpan in the loadChart() callback to ensure synchronicity.
       * stxx.loadChart({symbol: newSymbol, other: 'stuff'}, function() {
       * 	stxx.setSpan({
       * 		multiplier: 5,
       * 		base: "day",
       * 		padding: 30
       * 	});
       * });
       * @since
       * - 04-2015 Added "all", "today", "ytd" and automatic integration with quotefeed.
       * - 15-07-01 Changed `params.period` to `params.multiplier` for clarity.
       * - 15-07-01 Changed `params.interval` to `params.base` for clarity.
       * - 05-2016-10 Saves the set span in stxx.layout to be restored with the layout between sessions.
       * - 4.0.3 Saves all parameters of the requested span in stxx.layout to be restored with the layout between sessions. Previously only `multiplier` and `base` were saved.
       * - 5.0.0 When 1 'day' is requested data displayed will differ if current day is market day or the market is closed to ensure the span will have enough data.

     *
     * There are more timezones loaded in the the chart by default. You can get a list by running `timezoneJS.timezone.getAllZones();` from your browser console.
     * Feel free to add what you need to this map if you want users to use them.
     *
     * If you need to support other timezones, not currently loaded, a complete list can be downloaded from [here](http://download.chartiq.com/timeZones/timezoneDataObject.txt).
     *
     * This file is large, so add timezones with discretion.
     * Although we do update this file periodically ,it may not be available immediately after every timezone change.
     * As such, if you require immediate updates, you should subscribe to a notification system that alerts you of these changes, and then adjust the file as needed.
     * www.iana.org/time-zones is a good source.
     *
     * The following code snippet demonstrates how to do this. (You can also just add synonyms this way as well).
     * In order to save space, you may want to cherry pick the zones that you will need, and then add them in your initialization code.

     * Lastly, if you want users to be able to use the new timezones from the menus, be sure to also add the title for them to the `CIQ.timeZoneMap` object to keep the list and the settings in sync:
     *  ```
     *  CIQ.timeZoneMap["(UTC-05:00) Toronto"]="America/Toronto";

   * Makers are placed in containers which are `div` elements whose placement and size correspond with a panel on the
   * chart. A container exists for each panel.
   *
   * A marker's primary purpose is to provide additional information for a data point on the chart. As such, markers
   * can be placed by date, tick, or bar to control their position on the x-axis, and by value (price) to control their
   * position on the y-axis. Additional default positioning is also available, including the ability to create custom
   * positioning logic. Once the positioning logic is established for markers, they are repositioned as needed when the
   * user scrolls or zooms the chart.
   *
   * Alternatively, a marker can also be placed at an absolute position using CSS positioning, in which case the chart
   * does not control the marker's positioning.
   *
   * The default placement function for any markers is CIQ.ChartEngine#defaultMarkerPlacement.
   *
   * See the {@tutorial Markers} tutorial for additional implementation details and information about managing
   * performance on deployments requiring a large number of markers.

   * 					which the marker is associated.
   * 					If this value is not provided, the marker is set "above_candle" as long as a valid candle is selected
   * 					by `params.x`.
   * 					This element should be detached from the DOM. If an element is not provided, an empty `div` is created.

   * Values include:
   * - "date" — `params.x` must be set to a JavaScript date object. This will be converted to the closest `masterData`
   * position if the provided date does not exactly match any existing points. Be sure the same timezone as masterData is used.
   * - "master" — `params.x` must be set to a `masterData` position.
   * - "bar" — `params.x` must be set to a `dataSegment` position.
   * - "none" — Use CSS positioning; `params.x` is not used.
   * Values include:
   * - "value" — `params.y` must be set to an exact y-axis value. If `params.y` is omitted, the y-axis position defaults
   * to "above_candle".
   * - "above_candle" — Positions the marker right above the candle or line. If more than one marker is at the same position,
   * the markers are aligned upwards from the first. The `params.y` value is not used.
   * - "below_candle" — Positions the marker right below the candle or line. If more than one marker is at the same position,
   * the markers are aligned downwards from the first. The `params.y` value is not used.
   * - "under_candle" — Deprecated; same as "below_candle".
   * - "on_candle" — Position the marker in the center of the candle or line, covering it. If more than one marker is at the
   * same position, the markers are aligned downwards from the first. The `params.y` value is not used.
   * - "top" — Position the marker at the top of the chart, right below the margin. If more than one marker is at the same
   * position, the markers are aligned downwards from the first. The `params.y` value is not used.
   * - "bottom" — Position the marker at the bottom of the chart, right above the margin. If more than one marker is at the
   * same position, the markers are aligned upwards from the first. The `params.y` value is not used.
   * - "none" — Use CSS positioning; `params.y` is not used.

  /**
   * The market class is what the chart uses to to manage market hours for the different exchanges.
   * It uses `Market Definitions` to decide when the market is open or closed.
   * Although you can construct many market classes with different definitions to be used in your functions, only one market definition can be attached to the chart at any given time.
   * Once a market is defined, an [iterator]CIQ.Market#newIterator can be created to traverse through time, taking into account the market hours.
   * Additionally, a variety of convenience functions can be used to check the market status, such as CIQ.Market#isOpen or CIQ.Market#isMarketDay.
   *
   * A chart will operate 24x7, unless a market definition with rules is assigned to it.
   * See CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarket and CIQ.ChartEngine#setMarketFactory for instructions on how to assign a market definition to a chart.
   *
   * The chart also provides convenience functions that allows you to traverse through time at the current chart periodicity without having to explicitly create a new iterator.
   * See CIQ.ChartEngine#getNextInterval and CIQ.ChartEngine#standardMarketIterator for details.
   *
   * **Important:**
   * - If the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on is enabled, **only data within the defined market hours will be displayed on the chart** even if more data is loaded.
   * - Once a market definition is assigned to a chart, it will be used to roll up any data requested by the [periodicity]CIQ.ChartEngine#createDataSet, which will result in any data outside the market hours to be combined with the prior candle.
   * This may at times look like data is being **filtered**, but it is just being **aggregated**. To truly filter data, you must use the above add-on.
   *
   * `Market Definitions` are JavaScript objects which must contain the following elements:
   * - `name` : A string. Name of the market for which the rules are for.
   * - `rules` : An array. The rules indicating the times the market is open or closed. `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time. Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
   * - `market_tz` : A string. Time zone in which the market operates. See CIQ.timeZoneMap to review a list of all chartIQ supported timezones and instructions on how to add more.
   * - `hour_aligned`: A boolean. If set to `true`, market opening and closing times will be forced to the exact start of the hour of time, ignoring any minutes, seconds or millisecond offsets.
   *   > You should set this to `false` if your market opening and closing times are not aligned to the beginning to each hour.
   *   > Otherwise, forcing them to do so causes the iterator to generate `previous` and `next` times that could prevent it from properly moving trough the market hours.
   * - `convertOnDaily` : A boolean. By default, daily charts are not converted for timezone. Set this to true to convert for daily charts.
   * - `beginningDayOfWeek` : Weekday number (0-6) to optionally override CIQ.Market prototype setting of same name.
   * - `normal_daily_open`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal open time for a market.
   * - `normal_daily_close`: A string defining a time in `HH:mm` format. Set this to specify the normal close time for a market.
   * - `minimum_session_length`: The minimum interval of time used to test for a market session open.  See CIQ.Market#minimumSessionLength.
   *
   * Example:
   * ```
   * {
   * 		name: "SAMPLE-MARKET",
   * 		market_tz: "America/Chicago",
   * 		hour_aligned: true,
   * 		beginningDayOfWeek: 0,
   *		normal_daily_open: "09:00",
   *		normal_daily_close: "17:00",
   * 		rules: [
   * 				{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "17:00"}
   * 		]
   * };
   * ```
   *
   * Instructions for creating `Market Definitions`:
   *
   * - An empty market definition ( {} ) assumes the market is always open.
   * - Once a definition has rules in it, the market will be assumed open only for those defined rules. The absence of a rule indicates the market is closed for that timeframe.
   * - Market's time rules are specified in the market's local timezone.
   * - Seconds are not considered for open or close times, but are okay for intra day data.
   * - Rules are processed top to bottom.
   * - Rules can be defined for both primary and secondary market sessions.
   * - Rules for the market's primary session do not have a `name` parameter and are enabled by default.
   * - Rules for the market's primary session are mandatory.
   * - Rules for secondary market sessions, such as pre-market or post-market trading hours sessions,  require a `name` parameter.
   * - All secondary market session are disabled by default.
   *
   * 		This is a rule for a 'pre' market session:
   * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "08:00", "close": "09:30", name: "pre"}`
   *
   * - To enable or disable secondary market session rules by session name, use CIQ.Market#enableSession and CIQ.Market#disableSession.
   *  - **Important:** Enabling/Disabling market sessions will not automatically filter-out data from the chart, but simply adjust the market iterators so the x-axis can be displayed accordingly in the absence of data for the excluded sessions.
   *  - Data filtering can be done:
   *    - Manually by requesting pertinent data from your feed and calling CIQ.ChartEngine#loadChart
   *    - Automatically by using the CIQ.ExtendedHours visualization and filtering add-on.
   * - First, the `dayofweek` wild card rules are processed. As soon as a rule is matched, processing breaks.
   *
   * 		This rule says the market is open every Monday from 9:30 to 16:00:
   * 			`{"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:30", "close": "16:00"}`
   *
   * - After the `dayofweek` rules are processed all of the extra rules are processed.
   * - Multiple `open` and `close` times can be set for the same day of week. To indicate the market is closed during lunch, for example:
   * 	 ```
   * 	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "09:00", "close": "12:00"}, // mon
   *	 {"dayofweek": 1, "open": "13:00", "close": "17:00"}  // mon
   *	 ```
   *   - `close` time **must always** be later than `open` time.
   *   - Use the proper market timezone (`market_tz`) to prevent hours from spanning across days.
   *
   * - Wildcard rules should be placed first and more specific rules should be placed later.
   *
   * 		This rule is a wildcard rule for Christmas. If Christmas is on Monday, the
   * 		first set of rules will evaluate to true because the dayofweek rule for day
   * 		one will match. Then this rule will match if the date is the 25th of
   * 		December in any year.  Because open is 00:00 and close is 00:00, it will evaluate to false:
   * 			`{"date": "*-12-25", "open": "00:00", "close": "00:00"}`
   *
   * - After wildcard exceptions, any specific day and time can be matched.
   *
   * 		This rule says closed on this day only. Note that open and closed attributes
   * 		can be omitted to save typing if the market is closed the entire day:
   * 			`{"date": "2016-01-18"} //Martin Luther King day.`
   *
   * 		This rules says closed on 12-26:
   * 			`{"date": "2016-12-26"}, //Observed Christmas in 2016`
   *
   * 		This rule says partial session
   * 			`{"date": "2015-12-24", "open": "9:30", "close": "13:00"} //Christmas eve`
   *
   * See example section for a compete NYSE definition.
   *
   * Once defined, it can be used to create a new market instance.
   *
   * Example:
   * ```
   * var thisMarket = new CIQ.Market(marketDefinition);
   * ```
   *
   * If no definition is provided, the market will operate 24x7.
   *
   * Example:
   * ```
   * new CIQ.Market();
   * ```

     * <img src="./img-AVWAP-Edit-Dialog-Box.png" alt="AVWAP study edit dialog box">
     *
     * DialogHelpers also contain `attributes` which specify the formatting of dialog box input
     * fields. For example, the DialogHelper for the Anchored VWAP study contains the following:
     * ```
     * attributes:
     *     Anchor Date: {placeholder: "yyyy-mm-dd"}
     *     Anchor Time: {placeholder: "hh:mm:ss", step: 1}
     *     flippedEnabled: {hidden: true}
     * ```
     *
     * The `placeholder` property (in addition to its normal HTML function of providing placeholder
     * text) determines the input type of date and time fields. If the property value is "yyyy-mm-dd"
     * for a date field, the field in the edit dialog box is a date input type instead of a string
     * input. If the value is "hh:mm:ss" for a time field, the field is a time input type instead of a
     * string. If the `hidden` property of a field is set to true, the field is excluded from the
     * study edit dialog box.
     *
     * In the Anchored VWAP edit dialog box (see above), the Anchor Date field is formatted as a date
     * input type; Anchor Time, as a time input type. The Invert Y-Axis check box (the "flipped"
     * parameter) is hidden.
     *
     * **Note:** Actual date/time displays are browser dependent. The time is displayed in the
     * `displayZone` time zone. Time values are converted to the `dataZone` time zone before being
     * used internally so they always match the time zone of `masterData`. See
     * CIQ.ChartEngine#setTimeZone.

       * string. If the `hidden` property of a field is set to true, the field is excluded from the
       * study edit dialog box.
       *
       * In the Anchored VWAP edit dialog box (see above), the Anchor Date field is formatted as a date
       * input type; Anchor Time, as a time input type. The Invert Y-Axis check box (the "flipped"
       * parameter) is hidden.
       *
       * **Note:** Actual date/time displays are browser dependent. The time is displayed in the
       * `displayZone` time zone. Time values are converted to the `dataZone` time zone before being
       * used internally so they always match the time zone of `masterData`. See
       * CIQ.ChartEngine#setTimeZone.

       * 		`yyyy-mm-dd` or `hh:mm:ss` is set on an input field, the dialog displays a date or time
       * 		input type instead of a string input type.
       * - 7.1.0 It is expected that the study dialog's parameters section is refreshed whenever the
       * 		DialogHelper changes. The "signal" member should be observed to see if it has flipped.
